PDF Merger Web Interface
    Written by Jonas Lund 2024

    Description:
    This web application combines multiple PDF files into a single PDF file.
    The application runs entirely in the browser using client-side JavaScript, so no server is needed.
    Files will be merged in the order they are selected.
    
    Requirements:
    - A modern web browser
    - JavaScript enabled
    - pdf-lib library (automatically loaded from CDN)
    
    How to use:
    1. Open this HTML file in a web browser
    2. Click "Add PDF files" to choose multiple PDFs
    3. Arrange the files in desired order using drag and drop
    4. Click "Merge PDFs"
    5. The combined PDF will automatically download
    
    Output:
    - Creates a single PDF file containing all pages from input PDFs
    - Original files remain unchanged
    - Files are combined in the order shown in the list
    
    Note: Large PDF files may take longer to process since all processing happens in the browser.
